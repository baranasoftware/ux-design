## UX Design Approach 
Following steps describe the approach we take when designing a new user interface from ground up. 

* Empathize with users:
  * It's critical to understand the challenges that the target audience is experiencing.
  * A good way to do this is to meet with users and understand how users think, feel and pain points they experience.
  * We accomplish this by talking to them directly in user interviews.
* Conduct user interviews: 
  * User interviews can be conducted by meeting them in person and this process can be started by recruiting users.
  * User interviews can be done through surveys or using a screener as well.
  * When it's not feasible to conduct users interviews, we will conduct extensive online research to understand the problem and pain points.
  * When selecting the users we try to select users from a diverse group of users.
* Determine interview goals:
  * In order to conduct effective user interviews (or online research) it's important to come up with interview goals.
  * Asking following questions will help us to determine the goals of the interview:
    * What do we want to learn from the interview ?
    * Are there certain user problems or pain points that we need to empathize with ?
    * Are there any characteristics of users we want to interview ? Why ?
    * How much information should we have to ensure we get a comprehensive and balanced set of data?
  * Once we identified users to interview, we can start the process with an email to users:
    ```
